## ABOUT

**Intro:**
At AlterMundi, we firmly believe that technology must be a vehicle for equity and autonomy, not just an end in itself. We strive to democratize access to technological solutions, facilitating communities to manage and create their own tools. This commitment to open and accessible technology is fundamental for technological empowerment and sovereignty, and to ensure that our advances can be the seed for more developments in the world.

### Principles (We are passionately dedicated to):

**Open and Accessible Development**
We promote free software and open-source hardware solutions, as well as content with open licenses, so that they are accessible and adaptable by the communities that use them. This guarantees that technology meets the specific needs of its users and promotes technological independence.

**Responsible Innovation**
Our focus is on creating sustainable solutions that not only solve technical problems but also preserve environmental and social values, contributing directly to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

**Valuing Diversity**
We value and celebrate diversity within the communities and organizations we collaborate with. We recognize the richness that a variety of perspectives brings and are committed to supporting and promoting underrepresented sectors. We strive to drive developments and public policies that not only recognize diversity but also enhance and protect it, ensuring confidentiality and transparency in all our interactions.

**Empowerment through Technology**
We are committed to strengthening the autonomy of those marginalized in the information and technology society. Tools and training are provided that empower these communities and organizations, allowing them to take control over their technological developments and foster their active participation in society.

## HOW WE WORK

### Our Practice (Process)

At AlterMundi, we put our ideals into practice through a collaborative and respectful approach, ensuring that every project is handled with quality and consideration.

We adapt to changing needs and contexts to ensure that our projects not only meet their specific objectives but can also be adapted and scaled to maximize their utility in diverse environments.
